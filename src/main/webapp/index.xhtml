      <p id="Interests">
        Iâ€™m passionate about technology, especially AI and 3D simulation, and
        I love exploring new advancements in these fields. I enjoy doing
        sports like calisthenics or workout. Outdoor activities like hiking
        and climbing keep me active. Traveling to experience different
        cultures and broaden my perspective is something I cherish.

        I have already realized 3 websites as part of my studies. all of them
        were e-shops or marketplaces. Also I created a webApp when I was doing
        my internship in Generali VIE, this webApp was meant to prompt the SSO
        token of the user depending of his/her environment (production,
        pre-production,...).

        My goal for now is to get a job in the visual computing sector. I
        would be glad to work on simulations using unreal engines for example.
